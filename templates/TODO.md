## How to Use This Template

### Task Status Markers

```markdown
- [ ] Pending task
- [x] Completed task - YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS** - Task currently being worked on
- [ ] **BLOCKED** - Task waiting on something
```

### Priority Indicators

Tasks at the top of each section are higher priority. Use sections to group:

1. **Current Focus** - What's being worked on NOW
2. **Backlog** - Categorized future work
3. **Completed** - Archive of done items (with dates!)

### Date Stamps

**Always add completion dates** to finished tasks:
```markdown
- [x] Implement user auth - 2025-01-12
```

Get the current date:
```bash
date +"%Y-%m-%d"  # Output: 2025-01-12
```

### Categories

Common categories:
- **Infrastructure** - Setup, CI/CD, deployment
- **Features** - User-facing functionality
- **Bug Fixes** - Known issues to resolve
- **Testing** - Test coverage improvements
- **Documentation** - Docs, comments, READMEs
- **Refactoring** - Code quality improvements
